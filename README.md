Computer Hand-Gesture Control 

## Purpose
Provide a more intuitive and intelligent method of computer navigation

## Description
Machine Learning program that recognizes programmable hand poses and gestures and performs desired computer navigations.
Basically you can control you computer with hand gestures.
For example, a wave of your hand will switch tabs, a pointer finger controls the mouse, two fingers will scroll up or down, and much more.

## Demo

## How I made it

First I cleary wrote down what I wanted to make so I had a direct goal to work towards and then broke that goal down into manageble parts. 
My goal was to make a Computer Hand-Gesture Control system. Seemed very intimidating and overwhelming.
In parts, I needed to classify hand poses and then I needed to make it navigate the computer. That's a little better.

To classify hand poses, it first need to recognize a hand and then have a ML model output what pose the hand is in.
To navigate the computer I can use make the program input keyboard shortcuts or move the mouse position to switch tabs, scoll, click, etc.
